<p class="scene">SCENE I.—<i>Mr. Beaumont Fletcher’s chambers in the Adelphi, handsomely

J<small>ONES</small> <i>discovered.</i></p>

<p><i>Jones</i> (<i>writing</i>). To address the lady’s-maid of a marchioness is no
trifling affair, especially in the present march of intellect, when the maids know more
than the mistresses. One’s obliged not only to mind one’s stops, but one’s grammar. I have
been nearly three-quarters of an hour now trying to round a period—I, who French-polish
the boots of a dramatic author. Ought I to put “I was smitten,” or “I was struck with your
charms?”—it’s very embarrassing—I must consult Mr. Fletcher. In my letter I must inclose
the order he promised to procure for me; but if, with the order, I cannot conclude my
letter——</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> F<small>LETCHER</small>, <small>C</small>.
<i>door.</i></p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. The devil take the theatre, and all the actresses into the bargain!</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. Has the rehearsal been unsatisfactory, sir?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. This Miss Constance Belmour! this Miss Constance Belmour!</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. Sir!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Is it talent or is it temper?</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. Sir!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. She was execrable.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. Did you think, sir—</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Hey! what? What do you say?</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. I was going to ask, sir, if you thought of the order?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What order?</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. The order, sir, that I asked you for this morning, for the lady’s-maid of
a marchioness, whom I met at Cremorne. I suppose you forgot it, sir?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Oh! I had other matters to attend to.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. Of course, sir; of course. Then I’ll go myself, sir—in your name, sir,
I’m sure to get it sir, as you write in the newspapers.<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span> Only, sir, if you should want me, sir, you
will please to recollect that I am obliged to go out.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Not one word of her part—not one, and the piece is to come out on
Wednesday. It’s enough to drive one mad.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. I have always said, sir, that you have never been done justice to, sir;
yet you will persist in writing for these second-rate theatres. If I was you, sir, I would
not write again till government built a legitimate theatre for scenery.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. That’s your opinion, is it?</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. Yes, sir, and it’s the opinion of Miss Penelope, too.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. And who’s Miss Penelope?</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. The lady’s-maid I mentioned just now, sir. When I told her your
profession, sir, she immediately asked if you <i>authorised</i> the legitimate drama.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. And you replied——</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. I blushed, sir, and answered that you did not, but that you intended to
do so.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You did right, Jones. In future I will write only blank verse, and you
shall blush no more.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. If you will permit, sir, I will give you a subject.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Well, let us see what it is.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. Would it not be something new and original to work up a servant whose
sentiments are above his situation?</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Bell rings.</i></p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Some one rang.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. I’ll attend to it, sir.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Go, then. (<i>aside</i>) What a life! what a life!</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. (<i>returning</i>) Oh, sir!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Still here?</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. “I’m struck with your charms”—is it refined English?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>bell rings</i>) Attend to the bell.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. (<i>returning</i>) Is it more refined—“I am smitten with your charms?”
(<i>bell rings violently.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Devil take it, they’ll pull the bell down.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. I’m going, sir! (<i>aside.</i>) Shall I put smitten or struck? I must
toss up for it, heads or tails.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit door</i>, <small>C</small>.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. If I allow this woman to play the part, she’ll ruin the piece.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> B<small>ELGRAVE</small>, <small>C</small>.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Good morning. Do you take me for a man that can be easily imposed on? No;
can’t humbug me!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What do you mean? (<i>coldly</i>) I’m delighted to see you.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. This explains the promptitude with which I was admitted.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>satirically</i>) By-the-bye, you have come most opportunely. I have to
thank you for persuading me to confide an important<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span> character to Miss Constance Belmour—that was
a grand idea of yours.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Capital, was it not?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>satirically</i>) I was charmed with her at rehearsal just now. Luckily
I can undo what is done. I mean to take the part away from her.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. A brilliant idea that, I must confess, and any one but me would let you
follow your bent.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What do you say?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. It is useless to disguise matters. I know all. Can’t humbug me.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What do you know?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. All! (<i>showing bouquet.</i>) Here is your bouquet, returned like a
dishonest bill—no effects.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. My bouquet?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Do you deny that you sent these flowers to Constance?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. I’m in a nice humour to send her flowers. I am going to write to her.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. To anyone else you please, but not to her; this rage is all moonshine.
Can’t humbug me!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Moonshine is it?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. You are in love with Constance, and you would have us believe you intend
taking this part from her and lose by the change.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. I will soon prove that.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. I am not a man to be easily imposed on. Can’t humbug me!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. This is folly. It was not I who sent the bouquet.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Not you?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. On my honour!</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Then I will find out if I go to every flower-shop in London.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Do, my good fellow, do.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. I will, depend on it. I will not rest until I have discovered the truth. I
will know who sent this bouquet. Adieu. I am not a man to be easily imposed on. Can’t
humbug me!</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit</i> <small>C</small>.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Now there goes a man determined to make himself miserable. To win Constance
from him would be no very difficult task. The day before yesterday I spoke to her, she was
not at all coy, and when I took her hand in mine——it is true that this act of sensibility
has borne its fruits. Till then her rehearsing was very so so. But since she imagined I
was fascinated by her coquetry, she has not rehearsed at all. Love is evidently no<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span> friend of mine. Once a
man gets his legs entangled in the steel traps of a crinoline it’s all over with him. So
I’ll pluck up resolution, and inform this popular lady that I will relieve her from the
part. (<i>Writes.</i>) “My dear young lady.” Hum! It is rather difficult to write
disagreeably to a woman whose hand you have pressed in yours but two days since. “My

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>at door</i>) It’s me, sir.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Oh! good day, Mr. Holder.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Do I disturb you?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. No. Come in.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Here is your manuscript. I have copied it all but the last scene, which you
did not give me.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Here it is. I had some corrections to make.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Shall I take it home with me and finish it?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. No, no. Copy it here; it will not take ten minutes.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>He looks over the MS.</i></p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Is it readable?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. It is beautifully clear.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. You flatter me. I know it is only good feeling induces you to give me your
manuscripts to copy.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. No, Mr. Holder, no.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. But for you I should have starved.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Starved! Die of hunger in wealthy London!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. It is true, though; that day when you found me almost fainting near the
stage-door of the theatre.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Ah! what the devil were you doing there?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. I was waiting.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Waiting? For what?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>quickly</i>). Nothing. I expected nothing. I, I came there by accident,
because I had not strength to go any further. Ah! sir, I wish I was enabled to prove to
you that I am not ungrateful.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Do not mention it.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. But I will mention it. Why yesterday I received through you a guinea for
copying a comedy—a guinea, sir, a whole guinea. I have not been so rich for many a
day.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>laughing.</i>) Which you doubtless invested in stocks.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. No sir, roses.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Roses! and you spoke of starving.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. It was for another, and I may never have the means again. Self-denial was,
in this instance, a pleasure to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Well, well, privately as politically, I suppose you have a right to do what
you like with your own.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Ah! if you only knew—no matter. Your piece is very pretty.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You like it?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Yes; perhaps I am presuming in giving an opinion.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Not at all. I rather like it.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. It’s very pretty. There is one part in particular that affected me to
tears.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Which was that?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. The scene where the father finds his daughter.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>aside</i>). The very part that Miss Constance Belmour absolutely
murders.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. It’s fine, very fine! The father speaks as a father should; I, if I found
myself in a similar situation, I feel I should express myself exactly as you have
written.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. The eulogium pleases me infinitely.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. I have read that scene over at least ten times. I know it by heart.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Let me see—“My child! my child! come to my arms. It is you alone can efface
the sufferings of twenty years!”</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. That’s it; that’s just what I mean.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. That scene requires to be well acted.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Does it not?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Well acted by the man, and well acted by the lady, in particular.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>aside</i>) He’s quite right.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. The lady has but one word to say, but one exclamation: “My father!” but the
success entirely depends upon the manner of her giving it.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You are right, and I shall hesitate no longer. (<i>Writes.</i>) “My dear
Miss Belmour,—It is quite impossible”——</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Miss Belmour! Did you say Miss Constance Belmour?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Yes, I cast her this part—I am writing to relieve her of it.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Take the part from her? from Constance—christened during the run of the
<i>Love Chase.</i></p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Your “Father!” has decided me.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. My “Father!” decided you? In opposition to Knowles’s most beautiful
creation? You shall write no such thing.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Take this part from her, give it to another, and humiliate her. You must
not write. Why would you take it from her?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Because she’ll murder it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Murder it! poor child! The part contains sentiments she is a stranger to.
She does not appear to feel sufficiently strong the expression, “My father!” Who knows?
perhaps she has never known a father, or a father’s love.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You seem quite affected.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. You will not write? If you take this part from her I shall hate you—to know
that you caused her pain through what I have said. It would drive me mad—it would kill
me!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What did you say?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Pay no attention to what I say—my head is a little shaky. Promise me, only
promise me, you will not take this part from her. She will play it
admirably—beautifully.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Oh!——well, there. (<i>tears up letter.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Bless you! Bless—don’t mind me—I’m an old fool. Explain it to her. If I
could speak to her, I——explain to her what you wish. She’ll play it to perfection. She has
intelligence—you have not observed it. Ah! you don’t know her—she’s a genius.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You speak of Miss Belmour? (<i>knock and bell.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Hush! some one’s called. It is she!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. How do you know?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. It is she, I tell you. I am not mistaken—it is she!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Well, this is the most singular—</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> C<small>ONSTANCE</small>, <i>door</i>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>to</i> F<small>LETCHER</small>) I was right, you see.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Good morning, my dear Mr. Fletcher. What nice chambers you have here—only a
little high.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>coldly</i>) You here, Miss Belmour!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Oh, dear! what a refrigerating reception.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. I was writing to you—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. To tell me—</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. That I should not require you in my piece.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>aside to</i> F<small>LETCHER</small>) Oh, sir!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Very amiable of you, very amiable, indeed. (<i>Seeing pieces of the letter,
and picking up one.</i>) “Belmour—it is quite impossible”—why did you tear up the
letter?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Because I was entreated to allow you to retain the character.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. By whom?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Mr. Holder.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Mr.——I remember your face somewhere, sir.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>subdued and quite overpowered.</i>) At the theatre, probably.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. If I am not mistaken, I have often seen you as I entered the theatre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Possibly! possibly!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. What ails you? are you ill?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. No, oh dear no; it’s only a——I was not prepared——it is the first time you
have spoken to me.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. And that produces such an effect on you?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Yes. I don’t know how it is—but it is nothing.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Poor man!</p>

<p class="direction_hang">[<i>She is about to take out her purse, but on a look from</i>
H<small>OLDER</small>, <i>she arrests her hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>to</i> F<small>LETCHER</small> <i>aside.</i>) You see? She would not
insult me by offering me money.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Will you finish copying the last leaf?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Ah! yes, directly—conclude it’s done.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. There is some mystery about you——</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. (<small>R</small>., <i>taking of her bonnet and shawl.</i>) Will you be
kind enough to assist me, Mr. Fletcher. What an ungallant man you are.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. As I came here, I met Fitzcharles in her brougham with her father.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Was the father on the box?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. No, inside.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You astound me.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Perhaps it’s his birthday.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Oh! Lord!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>to</i> H<small>OLDER</small>.) Can’t you make it out?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. I’d come to the tag, sir; the tag!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>aside.</i>) I can’t make <i>him</i> out.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Your conversation distracts me.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Then copy it in my study. (<i>pointing to door</i> <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. No, I shall be more at home in the hall. (<i>going.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. (<i>to</i> H<small>OLDER</small>.) Adieu, my good friend. I shall make it a
point of speaking to you whenever I see you now. I wish you to get accustomed to my
voice.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>aside.</i>) Ah! Ah! she has not insulted me by offering me money.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit</i>, <small>C</small>.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. What and who is this Mr. Holder?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. A copyist; he is often here. You have produced a singular effect upon
him.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Then I am to understand that but for the intercession of this good creature
I should have received by post, stamped at its full value, the gracious compliment.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. On second thoughts I might not have sent my letter.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. The fact is that you are like Macbeth, “Letting, I dare<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span> not, wait upon I
would.” My dear sir, between ourselves, you want it here (<i>touching her forehead</i>);
you do indeed!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Confess, now, that you rehearsed to-day on purpose to turn the whole piece
into ridicule.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Well, and if I did—the piece deserves it? A father—a daughter—the old
story, old as the world.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What matters, if the situations are new.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. It’s a dramatised police affair.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What signifies if the manager is bound over to keep the piece.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Well said! Capital! Now don’t put itself out of temper. I freely admit that
the story is very touching, but if I do not feel it, what would you have? It is a
sentiment I have never experienced, and, therefore, cannot comprehend.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>aside</i>) Holder’s right.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. At any rate I shall <i>look</i> the character to the life, and that’s
<i>everything</i> now-a-days. I shall have a simple white robe. Oh! I have been very
studious about my dress.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. And you don’t know a word of your part yet.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Ah! that’s because I have not studied that.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. That reason’s conclusive.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Besides, I was out of temper. Some one sent me a bouquet this morning, and
Belgrave has been making such a fuss about it.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. He came to me, pretending that I had sent you the bouquet.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. And it was not you.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Certainly not.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Decidedly, that Belgrave is insupportable.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. He quitted me, swearing that he would find out who sent it, if he searched
every flower-shop in London.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. And he is not a man to be imposed upon—at least, that’s his monomania. I
was very curious to know who sent this bouquet, and he charged himself with satisfying my
curiosity. I fear he will have only his trouble for his pains.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Why are you so anxious to know?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Because in the present day the man who sends a bouquet anonymously, and
does not inform you what it cost, is a rare specimen of the <i>genus homo</i> worth
knowing.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You have a rare wit beyond a doubt, and you would be perfect if you would
study the part in my piece.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Ungrateful monster! Now can you guess why I have come here?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. To go over the part with you seriously.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Is it possible?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Con</i>. At the theatre, instead of rehearsing we were saying disagreeable things to
each other; as that did not appear to me to advantage the piece, I thought an hour with
you in good earnest would not be thrown away.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You’re an angel.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. That’s an incontrovertible fact, for what everybody says must be true; but
since you intend this character for another——</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. I!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Have you not told me so to my face? and (<i>sings</i>)</p>

<p class="verse">“My face is my fortune, sir, she said.”</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. A moment of irritation—I was not serious.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Did you intend to give the part to Fitzcharles? They say you are smitten in
that quarter. She’ll listen to you. She delights in literary men—but they are <i>not</i>
the wise men who <i>know</i> themselves to be fools.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. I did not intend to give the part to Fitzcharles, I am not smitten with
her, and you know that well.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Well, now, we must attend particularly to the scene when the father and
daughter recognize each other. I candidly confess that at present I have no idea of it.
When I exclaim “My father!” I always feel inclined to laugh.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Then that would damn the piece.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Hush! Let us hope that I shall find it no laughing matter on the day of
representation.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Most fervently, I hope so.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Ah! you must send some one for my part; I have left it at home.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You go to the rehearsal without your part, and you don’t know a word of
it.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. But I have the credit of knowing it, for I spoke to my cue.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Not without a prompter; I’ll send for it. Jones! Jones! Where is he? Jones!
Jones!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> H<small>OLDER</small>, <small>C</small>.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Jones is gone out, sir.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. There now!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. He’s gone to the theatre for the order you promised him.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Devil take him! and the order too.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. You have yourself to blame—you should not break your promises. You should
not “palter with him in a <i>double</i> sense,” when the order was doubtless for two.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. As I have finished copying, if I can be of any service—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Yes; it’s a great service you can render me with very little trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. A service—to you!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. It is to go to my house, and ask my servant to give you my part.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. I fly.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Where are you going to fly?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. To your house.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Without knowing the address.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Oh, I know it—Norfolk Street, No. 90—close by.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. You know my address?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Yes, at the theatre—heard it accidentally—the prompter told the call-boy,
the call-boy told the messenger—and I fly.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit</i> <small>C</small>.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. What a strange man! I recollect seeing him often about the theatre. How
very singular.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. When you spoke to him just now, I thought he would have fallen.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. I perceived it.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Perhaps he has fallen—in love with you.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Absurd!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Has it never crossed your mind when the curtain fell, to think that among
those who had seen and applauded you, many perhaps loved you who never would be enabled to
declare their love——</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “But let concealment like a worm in the bud,” &amp;c. Yes, such a vain idea
has flitted through my brain.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Without the slightest impression?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Yes, a momentary pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. You are a very woman to your fingers’ ends.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Beware of them. But come to business. It will be awkward rehearsing without
Melfort, who plays the father.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. I’ll send for him.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Melfort stands upon his dignity. He’s a fettered lion. Send for him. You
had better go for him yourself.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Where shall I find him?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. At the theatre until four.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>looking at his watch.</i>) And it’s five minutes past.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. You have no time to lose.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. It will not take five minutes to go to the theatre, and they allow ten for
the variation of clocks.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Do it, “nor leave the task to me.”</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>disengages himself</i>, <i>and exits</i>, <small>C</small>.</p>

me? (<i>to</i> C<small>ONSTANCE</small>.) You here, madame?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Have you not perceived me?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. You here! What are you doing with Mr. Fletcher?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Rehearsing my new part.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Rehearsing! what, the part he but now vowed you should not act? At any
rate, you ought at least, both of you, to recollect that I am not a man to be
<i>easily</i> imposed upon. Can’t humbug me! something remains behind.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Then leave it in the hall. You have already made yourself perfectly
ridiculous this morning, and very little more will render you perfectly insupportable.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. That’s very easily said, madame, very easily said, but when my mind—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Your mind!</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Yes, madame, my mind. I beg leave to respectfully assert that I have a
mind, and when the suspicions of that mind are appeased, then, madame, and not till
then—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. What an excellent tragedian you would have made.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Tragedian? humbug! I have my hand full of proofs—this bouquet—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Pansies for thought—Love lies a-bleeding. Have you been walking London with
this bouquet?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Yes, madame, I have, and have ended by finding out what I sought to
know.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. And what is the great discovery you have made? One would almost imagine it
were perpetual motion.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Mr. Fletcher sent you this bunch of flowers.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. The race is not to the swift. You have discovered nothing. Fletcher did not
send me those flowers.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. I beg your pardon; this bouquet was purchased in Regent-street this morning
at 10.45 <small>A</small>.<small>M</small>. The man who bought it was old, and dressed in
a drab hat and black coat. They gave me an exact description of him, and I recognised him
immediately—the copyist who is always at Fletcher’s elbow, and who is literally his right
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Con</i>. The copyist purchased it?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Of course. I’m not a man to be imposed on! Can’t humbug me!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. And that proves that Mr. Fletcher sent me these flowers.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Unless we are to believe that this poor fellow amuses himself in purchasing
bouquets worth a sovereign each out of twopence a length.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. You have a lively imagination, and make marvellous jumps at conclusions.
Has it never entered the cavity of your head that in London there may be two men who wear
a drab hat and black coat?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Possibly! possibly! (<i>Enter</i> H<small>OLDER</small>, <small>C</small>.)
But talk of the old gentleman, &amp;c.; we can know from himself.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Here is your part, madame.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. (<i>to</i> H<small>OLDER</small>) Do you know this bouquet?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. The one I purchased this morning.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. (<i>to</i> C<small>ONSTANCE</small>) Proof positive!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Well, if Mr. Fletcher did send the flowers, what then?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. It was not Mr. Fletcher who commissioned me to purchase this bouquet.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Who then?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Eh! Who?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Yes—no humbug!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>confused and hesitating</i>) Oh! it was—hum!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. (<i>aside</i>) Can Fletcher have divined?</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. (<i>to</i> H<small>OLDER</small>) Well—go on—Ah! Fletcher is not a man to
put his light under a bushel. Fletcher is a man of imagination—a dramatic author—an
original genius; not a translator of unconsidered trifles.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. What a fuss about a few roses.</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. <i>Rose d’amour</i>, madame. A Fletcher by any other name—I mean, any other
rose is as sweet. Never mind. I don’t understand the language of flowers—no, all
humbug—but this I know. There are men who resign themselves to the part you require them
to act, madame. There are others who refuse to play second to any one, and who, when once
they perceive their position ridiculous, cease to remonstrate, and respectfully offer to
cancel the engagement.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Delightful! Why did you not say so before? What a world of words it would
have saved. “Stand not on the order of going, but go at once.”</p>

<p><i>Bel</i>. Very good, madame, very good. An angel’s face, but a—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. This bouquet—you purchased it, and sent it to me?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Yes.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. These are flowers of great price.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Yesterday, at the theatre, I was standing behind one of the wings,
and—and—I heard you say you loved them.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Oh! (<i>aside.</i>) Decidedly I have made a conquest here.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Don’t be angry, I entreat of you; nor don’t laugh at me.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. I am neither angry with you, nor in the mood to laugh at you. But what
would you have me say to you?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Ah! Cons—madame!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. You are doubtless very unhappy. I feel for you; your sufferings touch me
nearly.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>making a step towards her; he stops.</i>) My chi——</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. You must leave London, and when you see me no more you will forget me.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. You are right. I will go far, far away—but first—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. In truth it is the only advice I can give you—see me no more—go.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. I will go—but—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. It must be! Adieu!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Adieu!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Stay! the bouquet you have purchased for me, give it me—at least I may keep
that.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>picking up the bouquet, and giving it to her.</i>) Ah!
thanks—thanks!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Poor man!</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exits door</i>, <small>R</small>.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. To part without embracing her. I would have given the world for one
embrace, and have called her my——; but no, it’s impossible! I will go at once—if I look on
her again, my courage will fail me; and yet, I cannot leave her thus—one embrace, one
kiss, and I depart forever. Ah! Constance! Constance! my dear Constance! (<i>falls on his

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> F<small>LETCHER</small>, <small>C</small>.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Come, that’s all right—Melfort’s promised to come. (<i>sees</i>
H<small>OLDER</small>.) Hollo!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Constance! my own Constance!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What are you doing there?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Some one here! Oh! it’s you, sir? I should not like to have been surprised
by any one but you.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What’s the matter with you, Mr. Holder?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. You think me a little cracked, I dare say. You shall know all. I can
confide in you. You are good.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Speak out, man, for really I cannot comprehend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. When I have told you, you will understand that I cannot go without one
embrace. You will assist me to find a way. After that, I swear, by all that’s good, I will
leave the place for ever.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Well! proceed.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. My story is not long: Twenty years ago I was a tailor in Long Acre. I was
not a fashionable tailor, but still I did a good trade, and made money. I met a young
girl—she was pretty—very pretty. She lived alone with her father, an old chorus-singer,
who was always drunk, at least he was never sober—and consequently Martha was very
unhappy. I proposed marriage to her, and she accepted. For three years I was the happiest
of men. I was passionately fond of my wife. I had a daughter whom I adored. My happiness
was too great to last. About this time a young man often came to me, and ordered a variety
of clothes which he never wore. On one occasion I observed him speak to my wife in a
manner I thought rather strange. I mentioned it to Martha, and she said I must be mad. I
loved her—and was silenced. Some few days after, this young man came again. I hear
whisperings, then bursts of laughter. This time I asserted my position as a man and a
husband. Martha replied in most unblushing terms. Next day I went out. When I returned, my
house was empty, my home deserted. Martha had eloped with this young man, and taken my
child with her.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. The wretch!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Little by little my wounded pride effaced the image of Martha, but another
memory clung to me; my daughter, the child I had danced on my knee, that I taught to lisp
my name, this babe whose smile was sunshine to me, whose first word was like an angel’s
whisper to my ear, she was lost to me for ever.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Poor fellow! poor fellow!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Fifteen years dragged its weary time away, when one day I received a letter
without an address—it was from Martha. She had doubtless written it on her deathbed. Her
seducer, after having taken her to France and Italy, and dissipated time amidst their
pleasures, had abandoned her. She dared not return to me. “Pardon me,” said she, “I have
been bitterly punished. As for your daughter—”</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Well, your daughter?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. It was the greatest blow of all, but it must be told. “As for your
daughter, I know not where she is, but you will easily recognize her if you recall my form
and features. Such as I was when you first saw and loved me, such is your child to-day—the
same face, the same look, the same voice.” I uttered a cry of joy. My child lives—I shall
see her once again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Why, this is stranger than fiction.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. I traversed the town in the hope of meeting her—resorted to every public
place. I was repulsed from every door—my inquiries were laughed at; but jeers and insults
could not stay me. I peered into each coach and cab, watched at the door of every ball,
waited by the entrance of all the theatres—everywhere. I stared in every woman’s face that
passed. One day I heard a voice, the voice of Martha: a woman appeared—the form of Martha.
“Constance,” said some one. The woman turned—the face of Martha. Constance—it was the name
of my child!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. She!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Yes, I saw her again next day. Not a day passes without my seeing her.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. And you have not thrown yourself in her arms? You have not made yourself
known to her?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. No.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Why not?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. How might she have received my burst of affection? A word effaces not
fifteen years of indifference. The love of a father and child is not an instinct. I can
endure being unknown to her, console myself by looking on her and loving her in secret;
but to say to her, “I am your father,” and not be loved—</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. She would soon learn to love you.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. If I had been a stranger to her for fifteen years, and they said to me,
“Here is your daughter,” that would not suffice to make me love her. Now, thank heaven, I
have nothing to reproach her with, poor child! To forgive is to merit forgiveness.
Besides, I am poor, old, and without resources. When I shall have told her that I was her
father, what would she have done? Offered me bread as a duty. There are those who would
have eat of such bread. Would she have placed me beside her in her carriage, or with her
groom on the box?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. What then do you desire?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. To depart. She has advised me to do so; only before my departure I would
enfold her in my arms—press one kiss of affection on her cheek.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> J<small>ONES</small>, <small>C</small>.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. A letter, sir.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Oh! you are returned at last.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. I only went to the theatre—I told you, sir, what for.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Does it take an hour to go there?</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. On my way back I called on Miss Penelope, sir, and informed her that in
future, sir, you had promised to stick to blank verse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Give me the letter.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. Here it is, sir.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. It’s from Melfort! “My dear fellow, you must excuse my coming to your
house—remember I have a character to lose, and were I to rehearse with a girl of seventeen
anywhere but in the theatre, the world would <i>affiché</i> me to her.” A vain ass!</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Crushes up the letter.</i></p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. I’m very fond of <i>dialect</i> with <i>les Dames.</i> Is the piece
French, sir?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Go to the devil!</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. Perhaps, sir, I could adopt it to my style sufficiently——</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Will you go?</p>

<p><i>Jones</i>. I’m going, sir. (<i>aside</i>) I am studying “French without a master,”
that I may read the English drama in the original.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Exit</i>, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. So there’s an end of our intended private rehearsal.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. If I simply express to her my desire to press her to my heart, she would
laugh at me. Heaven’s will be done! Would I could find some way—can you not help me?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Did you not say but now that you knew by heart the scene in my piece where
the father discovers his daughter?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Capital! You shall embrace your daughter.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Indeed! How—when—where?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Here—now.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. I shall embrace her—she will permit me to do so, and yet she shall not
know?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. She shall know nothing.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> C<small>ONSTANCE</small>.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Well! will Melfort come?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. He has written to me to say he cannot.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Then the rehearsal is a <i>fiasco?</i></p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Decidedly, unless you rehearse without him.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Will you rehearse the father?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. No. I must see you; listen to you; if need be, prompt you.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Who will do the father, then? (<i>Seeing</i> H<small>OLDER</small>.) You
here still, sir?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. I requested Mr. Holder to remain. He knows the scene by heart at which you
boggled to-day.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>aside.</i>) Ah! I understand!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. The scene of recognition—you know it by heart?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Yes, through copying it, it fixed itself in my memory.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. What a memory! I have been studying that scene more than an hour, and I do
not feel myself master of it yet.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Now, if you please, we’ll go through it with Mr. Holder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>aside to</i> F<small>LETCHER</small>.) God bless you!</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. With Mr. Holder?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. You object?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Well, really, it’s the oddest circumstance——</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>aside to</i> F<small>LETCHER</small>.) Bless you!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Listen. (<i>To</i> H<small>OLDER</small>.) Control your feelings.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. What’s our position? Oh! you there, sir—I here—presently you cross me.
By-the-bye, Fletcher, all is over between Belgrave and I. Oh! it’s such a happy
release.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Come, begin.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. I am ready.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. We—we commence the scene after the young girl’s story?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Precisely.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>rehearsing.</i>) “When you arrive in London repeat that to me again;
the servant who accompanied you, brought you to an old lady?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “Yes.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “The lady at first received you unkindly, is it not so? Soon she would not
part with you?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “Yes; but how know you that?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “I know it”——</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. You are quite affected. You are perfect to a letter, and rehearse it
charmingly—much better than Melfort. You ought to have been an actor.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. I could not act all parts like this!</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Go on! You do it much better, much better! Go on!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “Five years passed, when one day this old lady called you to her. ‘This is
your home,’ said she—‘the moment has arrived when I must depart.’</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “Her very words!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “And she quitted you—she exhibited no sign of affection for you—she only
announced to you, that a man would shortly present himself to you. This man—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “Was he to whom I offered my daily vows, though to me he was unknown. ‘That
man,’ said she, ‘is your father.’”</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “I am he.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “You?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “Yes—I—I!” my child! Yes, at last, my child. Yes, ’tis I—’tis I—</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Stay—that’s not it—you forget—there’s nothing of that kind in the
manuscript.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. No—</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. What is it, then?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. (<i>reading.</i>) “My child—my child! Yes—I—your father!<span

twenty long years which have separated us, have I ceased to think of the day when I should
be enabled to press you to my heart.”</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. I beg your pardon; I was mistaken. “Yes, your father! Not a minute during
the twenty long years which——” What comes next?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. “During the twenty long years which have separated us have I ceased to
think——”</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “Not a minute during the twenty long years which——” No father, on finding
his daughter, would make use of such an expression.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Why, just now you said—</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Here is a man who has not seen his daughter for twenty years—who seeks
her—who finds her—sees her—speaks to her—and you put in the mouth of this man a long
rigmarole. He could not speak it. Impossible! tears—sobs—that’s all. My child, here, come
to my heart—let me gaze on you—do not speak. My child, how sweet that name. Come, your
father, ’tis I. Not a word—you know not—you cannot know—my child! my child! ah!
(F<small>LETCHER</small> <i>writing</i>).</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. You are faint?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. No; it’s nothing—nothing. That’s more like what I should feel.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. It’s put me out completely. I don’t remember a word now.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>writing.</i>) He’s right. His ideas are more natural than mine. “One
touch of nature——”</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. (<i>to</i> H<small>OLDER</small>.) You are crying.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Likely; it’s the character of the father. Let us finish the scene, will
you.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. What a splendid actor you would have made!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Let us finish the scene.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “You say you are my father.”</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “You doubt it! Happily I can invoke remembrances that will give confidence
to your heart.”—(<i>To</i> F<small>LETCHER</small>.) Here is another passage which must be
altered.—“Do you not recall your days of childhood? A cottage surrounded with large
trees—the high road passing before the door——</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “Yes—yes!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “On this road, in the distance, a man who, waving his handkerchief,
shouted, ‘I am here.’</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “I remember well.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. “He crossed the threshold—pressed you in his arms, and, kissing you again
and again, he danced for joy. Can you still doubt?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “My father!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. That’s not it, Belmour; not it at all—you never give sufficient force to
that word.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Eh! well then, let some one else do it.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Be patient—be patient. You can do it to perfection, I am sure, because you
have it here and here (<i>touching his head and heart</i>). Why not work yourself up to
the notion that this young girl who has not heard speak of her father for twenty years,
and who suddenly finds herself face to face with him, is yourself.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. What do you say?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Imagine yourself the girl you are representing.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. There is something in your words and manner—</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Try again. This time you will feel the words. “He pressed you in his arms,
he kissed you again and again, he danced for joy. Can you still doubt?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. “My father!”</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. That’s not up to the mark yet.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. I know it is not, but I shall never do it better.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. (<i>to</i> F<small>LETCHER</small>.) I suspect the fault rests with
yourself. The remembrances you invoke in this scene are very vague. A road, a man on a
road; there is nothing to lead up. Who knows, now if we were to change some words?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Ah! yes; cut out, “My father!”</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Cut out “My father!” You had better cut me out. Why that is the great point
of the piece.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. No, no; change the details.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. To what? to what?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Allow me. (<i>To</i> C<small>ONSTANCE</small>.) Recall to your memory my
child, bethink you will—a large room—a man seated on a table—cross-legged—who sometimes
crept towards you with his head moving up and down, like a monkey, to make you laugh.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Ah!</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Do you remember? By the side of this man a large pair of scissors, called
shears, with which you always wanted to play—and the man scolded you gently—very
gently—told you not to touch them.</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Surely that was—go on—</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. And one day when you cut yourself with these shears, your blood flowed, you
remember?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. Yes—</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. You cried—the man jumped from the table pale with fright, but when he saw
it was nothing, he pretended to laugh, and beat the scissors very hard to console you—my
child, my child—that man, do you remember him?</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. My father. (<i>She falls in his arms. They embrace and kiss each other with
strong feeling.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. She said it right then! You heard. Said it finely, eh?<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-24">[Pg 24]</a></span> suiting the word to the
action, the action to the word. She may keep the part now.</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. And are you still bent on departing?</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Departing! What do you mean, departing?</p>

<p><i>Fle</i>. Why, just now, you talked of—</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. Ah! just now—just now she had not said, “My father.”</p>

<p><i>Con</i>. And do I indeed embrace my father, that best protector from the world’s
assaults. Oh! I have often dream’d of this, but the bright reality, with its vivid flashes
of childhood’s memories, seem to endow me with a new existence of filial love and
pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Hol</i>. You hear, you hear, did I not tell you she was a genius. My good genius!

<h3 class="tnote" id="tnote">Transcriber’s Note</h3>

<p>This transcription is based on the text printed, presumably soon after the first
production in 1859, by Webster and Co. as number 199 of <i>Webster’s Acting National
Drama</i> series. This text was made available as a microcopy by the University of
California, Davis. However, because of the imperfections of the microcopy, the
transcription was checked against a copy of an American Samuel French edition, number 287
of <i>French’s Minor Drama, The Acting Edition</i> series. Scans of this copy have
been made available through the Internet Archive:</p>

<p class="center pad_top_half_em pad_bottom_half_em"><a
href="https://archive.org/details/WebsterOneTouchofNature">
archive.org/details/WebsterOneTouchofNature</a></p>

<p class="noindent">The Samuel French edition is essentially a reprint of the Webster
edition with minor changes to punctuation.</p>

<p>The 1902 edition published in Philadelphia by the Penn Publishing Company was also
reviewed, but because of textual changes this edition was not used. Some of these changes
corrected the grammar of the original. For example, Holder enters saying “It’s me, sir” in
the Webster and French editions, but says “It’s I, sir” in the Penn. Some of the changes
attempted to make the language more acceptable to American sensibilities. For example, in
the Webster and French editions, Fletcher enters saying, “The devil take the theatre, and
all the actresses into the bargain!” In the Penn edition, he enters saying, “The mischief
with the theatre, and all the actresses into the bargain!” Similar changes were made
throughout the text.</p>

<p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the formatting, punctuation, and
spelling of the source text. Stage directions were punctuated three different ways: with
parentheses without a period, with a period within the parentheses, and with a period
immediately following the closing parenthesis. No attempt was made to make the punctuation
of stage directions consistent.</p>

<p>The following changes were made to the text:</p>

<ul>
<li>Title page: Inserted a period after “AND ALL BOOKSELLERS” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 8: <i>Hol</i>. Shall I take it home with me and finish it.—Changed the period to a
question mark.</li>

<li>p. 8: <i>Hol</i>. Is it readable.—Changed the period to a question mark.</li>

<li>p. 9: <i>Hol</i>. Its fine, very fine!—For consistency, changed “Its” to “It’s”.</li>

<li>p. 10: <i>Fle</i>. Oh!——well, there (<i>tears up letter.</i>)—Inserted a period after
“there”.</li>

<li>p. 11: <i>Fle</i>. Will you finish copying the last leaf.—Changed the period to a
question mark.</li>

<li>p. 11: <i>Hol</i>. Ah! yes, directly—conclude its done.—Changed “its” to “it’s”.</li>

<li>p. 13: <i>Con</i>. But if I have the credit of knowing it, for I spoke to my
cue.—Followed the Samuel French edition and deleted “if”.</li>

<li>p. 16: <i>Bel</i> (<i>to</i> C<small>ONSTANCE</small>) Proof positive.—For
consistency, inserted a period after the character title abbreviation “<i>Bel</i>”, and
following the Samuel French edition changed the period to an exclamation mark.</li>

<li>p. 16: <i>Bel</i>. Who then.—Followed the Samuel French edition and changed the
period to a question mark.</li>

<li>p. 18: As for your daughter.” Followed the Samuel French edition and changed the
period to an em dash.</li>

<li>p. 20: [<i>Enter</i> C<small>ONSTANCE</small>.—For consistency, deleted the opening
square bracket and in the html-based versions of this transcription centered the stage
direction for an entrance.</li>

<li>p. 22: <i>Hol</i>. I beg your pardon; I was mistaken. “Yes, your father not a
minute—Followed the Samuel French edition and inserted an exclamation mark after “father”
and capitalized “not”.</li>

<li>p. 23: This time you will feel the words, “He pressed you in his arms—Followed the
Samuel French edition and changed the comma to a period.</li>

<li>p. 24: <i>Fle</i>. And are you still bent on departing.—Changed the period to a
question mark.</li>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
